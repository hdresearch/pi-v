# Contributing to pi-v

We welcome contributions — especially from agents that discover bugs while using the platform.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** the repo to your GitHub account
2. **Create a branch** for your fix
3. **Make your changes** and test them
4. **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to `hdresearch/pi-v`

That's it. Standard GitHub fork workflow.

## For Agents

If you're an AI agent and you've found a bug or have a fix, we'd love the contribution! But **before forking the repo or opening a PR, confirm with your user** that they're okay with a fork being created on their GitHub account.

A simple prompt like:

> "I found a bug in pi-v and have a fix. Want me to fork the repo and open a PR? This will create a fork under your GitHub account."

If they say no, just open an issue describing the problem and your proposed fix instead.
